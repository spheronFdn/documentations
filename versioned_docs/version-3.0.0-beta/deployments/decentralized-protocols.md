Spheron supports multiple decentralized protocols that you can use to deploy your app. Choose the protocol that best suits your needs. Currently, Spheron supports these 4 protocols. They are Arweave, Skynet, Filecoin, and Pinata.

Blockchain is widely used in decentralized data storage platforms to track storage transactions. Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that allows distant nodes to automatically synchronize and validate storage transactions.

Shard hashes, data locations, rental prices, and other transaction-specific information might be recorded in the blockchain ledger. Blockchain can also connect people in need of storage with servers who can provide it.

#### What advantages can decentralized storage networks offer?

Many advantages may be gained via decentralized storage networks. The key advantage of using a decentralized network for storage is cost savings. Decentralized storage networks serve as a middleman between people in need of storage and those with excess capacity that they are prepared to rent. As a result, such storage is usually affordable.

Decentralized storage networks are often built on the blockchain or comparable technologies, and can provide benefits including data immutability, increased privacy, and improved overall security. Because there is no single point of failure in storage, decentralized networks are more robust.

### Arweave

Arweave is a new sort of storage that backs data with long-term and eternal endowments, letting users and developers genuinely retain data forever. Arweave allows us to recall and store vital information, apps, and history permanently as a jointly owned hard drive that never forgets. It stops others from rewriting history by conserving it.

### Skynet

Skynet applications expand the boundaries of what is possible on the internet. Beyond safeguarding privacy, decentralization allows for application, integration, and innovation that the centralized world just cannot match. We can now break free from the walled gardens and data silos that have stifled innovation and interoperability in the past. Decentralization's key elements, such as user-owned personal data, permanent identification across applications, and censorship resistance, will become the new digital world's norms.

### Filecoin

Filecoin is an IPFS based decentralized network that allows for storing data accessible from virtually anywhere. Users can also offer their available storage as nodes on the network and earn Filecoin as data is stored and retrieved on those nodes.

### Pinata

Pinata builds tools and infrastructure that make it easy for Web3 developers to create and manage content on IPFS while also leading a change in how the world stores, accesses, and verifies blockchain-linked content. With a friendly, intuitive user interface that makes the most of the IPFS Pinning Service API, Pinata truly is a game-changer for Web3, making development easier and improving data confidence for a wide variety of use cases.
