<font size="4"> Continuous Deployment is now possible with ArGo directly from Github, users can now enable continuous deployment and every merge to the branch will trigger a new build and their website will be always updated with the latest changes. We have mitigated the hassle of manually deploying the website again and again. </font> <br/><br/>

<font size="4"> <b>Note: To use Continuous Deployment make sure you accept the updated ArGo Github app permissions. It is necessary for Continuous  Deployment to work.</b> </font> <br/><br/>
